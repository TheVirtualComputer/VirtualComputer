# VirtualComputer
The emulator for name-brand PCs.

NOTE: To anyone reading this, I have just wanted to say that I have recently suffered a terrible tragedy in life and would rather not be bothered with requests at this time, and as such will probably not be active on the discussion boards for quite a while. What I am going through in life right now is so deeply painful that I cannot even properly describe it to you, however, since none of this was your fault in any way, I feel that it would be unfair to take it out on all of you, or any one of you for that matter. However, either way, I feel that I cannot be as active as I once was, and will instead focus most of my development on things that I do privately in my free time, but either way I would rather not be bombarded with feature requests or things of that type.

ROM image uploads however will still be greatly apprciated and accepted, since the emulator is still officially in development, and so if any of you have any ROM images for any machines or system boards that you would like to share with me, just upload them here or send them to one of the forums where I happen to be a member, and I'll check it all out when I have the chance.

Thank you all for your patience and time, and for willing to bear with me while I go (and suffer) through something that was not in any way your fault.
