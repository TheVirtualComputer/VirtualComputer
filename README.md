# VirtualComputer
The emulator for name-brand PCs, all the way from A to Z.

NOTE: The emulator project is (mostly) back to normal now, with once again regularly scheduled product releases planned for the future and lots of bugs fixed in the latest version, however, the next release will take some time because of a massive overhaul to the source code required for support for new chipsets and features, mainly those ported over from 86Box and PCem.
